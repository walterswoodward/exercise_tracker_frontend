# Exercise Tracker Frontend

## Introduction

Welcome to Exercise Tracker. I built this app through as a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum to continue to hone my skills in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).  

* Please note that due to Heroku's Dyno sleeping feature (active for free accounts), which unloads unused servers from server memory, it is likely that the first call to the server will take substantially longer (10-20 seconds). This is not an error in the scripts, just a good feature implemented by Heroku to keep the cost of free-tier services to a minimum.  Thank You!
